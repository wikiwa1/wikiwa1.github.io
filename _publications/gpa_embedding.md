Subfactors of the hyperfinite II$$_1$$ factor with "exotic" properties can be constructed from nondegenerate commuting squares of multi-matrix algebras. We show that the subfactor planar algebra of these commuting square subfactors necessarily embeds into Jones' graph planar algebra associated to one of the inclusion graphs in the commuting square. This leads to a powerful obstruction for the standard invariant of the subfactor, and we use it to give an example of a hyperfinite subfactor with Temperley-Lieb-Jones standard invariant and index $$\frac{5+\sqrt{13}}{2}$$, i.e. the index of the Haagerup subfactor. We are led to a conjecture pertaining to Jones indices of irreducible, hyperfinite subfactors.
